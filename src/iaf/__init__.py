"""Integrate-and-Fire Neural Network Simulation Package.

This package provides tools for simulating integrate-and-fire neural networks with
various plasticity mechanisms, input populations, and synapse types. The primary
components are:

- simulation: Core simulation framework
- iaf_neuron: Integrate-and-fire neuron implementation
- synapse_group: Synapse models with different plasticity rules
- source_population: Input sources for the network
- plotting: Visualization tools for simulation results
- experiments: Utilities for running experiments
- config: Configuration classes for all components
